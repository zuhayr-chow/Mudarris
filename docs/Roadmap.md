# Product Roadmap — Mudarris

**Product Type:** Educational SaaS (Islamic & Qur’anic schools)  
**Phase:** Planning & MVP Definition  
**Roadmap Type:** Conceptual (Subject to Validation)

This roadmap outlines a **phased approach** to building Mudarris, prioritizing learning, validation, and responsible expansion over rapid feature growth.

---

## Phase 1: MVP (Now)

**Objective:** Validate whether structured lesson tracking and parent visibility improve consistency and accountability in Qur’an education.

### Focus Areas
- Core lesson tracking workflows
- Passive parent visibility
- Minimal administrative overhead

### Key Capabilities
- User and classroom management  
- Daily lesson planner (Hifz, Murājaʿah, Tilāwah)  
- Lesson history timeline  
- Parent read-only access  
- Class announcements  
- Basic Qur’an viewer (highlight only)  

### Success Criteria
- Teachers consistently log lessons  
- Parents regularly view progress  
- Students demonstrate improved consistency  

---

## Phase 2: Enhancement (Next)

**Objective:** Strengthen engagement and insights without increasing complexity.

### Potential Enhancements
- Student profile summaries (e.g., surahs completed)  
- Consistency indicators (e.g., last 7 days activity)  
- Improved onboarding and guidance  
- Optional offline support / caching  
- Lightweight notifications (configurable)

### Validation Focus
- Which enhancements provide real value  
- Which features remain unused  
- Feedback from teachers and parents  

---

## Phase 3: Assistive & Insight Tools (Later)

**Objective:** Support teachers with insights while preserving traditional instruction.

### Exploratory Concepts
- AI-assisted lesson summaries (teacher-reviewed)  
- Progress trend insights (non-automated recommendations)  
- Teacher-facing analytics (usage-informed only)

### Guardrails
- AI assists but does not replace teacher judgment  
- No automated religious or instructional decisions  
- Human oversight required for all insights  

---

## Phase 4: Institutional Scaling (Future)

**Objective:** Support growth across multiple classes and institutes.

### Possible Capabilities
- Multi-class management for institutions  
- Role-based admin views  
- Export or reporting tools (on demand)  
- Compliance-aware data controls  

This phase is dependent on sustained adoption and validated demand.
