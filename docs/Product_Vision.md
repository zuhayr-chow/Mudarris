# Product Vision — Mudarris

## Vision Statement

Mudarris aims to become a **simple, reliable Educational SaaS platform** purpose-built for **Islamic and Qur’anic schools**, helping teachers, parents, and students maintain structure, accountability, and transparency in Qur’an education without increasing administrative burden.

The vision is to support high-quality Qur’anic learning by making lesson progress visible, consistent, and respectful of traditional teaching methodologies.

---

## Long-Term Vision

Mudarris is envisioned as a **foundational system of record for Qur’an education**, where:

- Teachers can log lessons clearly without disrupting their teaching flow  
- Parents can stay informed about progress without constant manual updates  
- Students can build consistency and accountability through visible lesson history  

Over time, Mudarris may evolve to include assistive tools and insights that **enhance the role of the teacher**, while preserving the human, spiritual, and instructional nature of Qur’anic learning.

## Target Market

Mudarris is designed specifically for:

- Islamic schools and madāris  
- Online Qur’an institutes  
- Masjid-based education programs  
- Independent Qur’an instructors teaching remotely or in-person  

The product follows a **B2B2C model**:
- Institutions or teachers adopt the platform  
- Parents and students benefit from structured visibility and clarity

## Core Principles

The product vision is guided by the following principles:

### 1. Simplicity Over Complexity  
Mudarris prioritizes ease of use and minimal setup, recognizing that many Qur’an teachers prefer simple, focused tools over complex systems.

### 2. Accountability Through Visibility  
Progress should be visible to parents and students without creating additional administrative work for teachers.

### 3. Teacher-Centered Design  
Mudarris adapts to existing Qur’an teaching styles (Hifz, Murājaʿah, Tilāwah) rather than forcing standardized academic workflows.

### 4. Respect for Traditional Instruction  
The platform supports traditional Qur’anic pedagogy and **does not attempt to replace teacher judgment or spiritual guidance**.

### 5. Incremental and Intentional Growth  
Features are introduced gradually, ensuring alignment with real needs in Islamic education environments.

## What Mudarris Is Not

To maintain focus, Mudarris is intentionally **not**:

- A full-featured Learning Management System (LMS)  
- A gamified points-based learning platform  
- A replacement for teachers or in-person instruction  
- A content-heavy Qur’an app with reciters, tafsīr libraries, or media-first experiences  

Mudarris focuses on **structure, tracking, and clarity**, leaving content delivery to teachers and institutions.
