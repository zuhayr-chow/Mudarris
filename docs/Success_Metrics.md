## Guardrails & Interpretation

- Metrics are used to guide product decisions, not evaluate individuals  
- No performance ranking or gamification is introduced  
- Metrics support improvement, not pressure

## Validation Plan (Future)

Once a prototype or MVP is available:
- Conduct small-scale pilots with teachers  
- Collect feedback after defined periods  
- Refine metrics based on observed behavior

## Disclaimer

All success metrics are **hypothesized** and subject to revision based on real-world usage and feedback.
