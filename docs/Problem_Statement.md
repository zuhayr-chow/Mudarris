# Problem Statement — Mudarris

## Background

Qur’an education in Islamic schools, madāris, masjid programs, and online institutes is often delivered through highly personalized and traditional teaching methods. While this approach preserves quality and spiritual guidance, it frequently relies on **informal systems** to track progress and communicate updates.

Common tools include:
- WhatsApp messages
- Verbal updates
- Paper notebooks
- Teacher memory

These methods do not scale well and create gaps in visibility and consistency.

## Core Problems

### 1. Lack of Structured Lesson Tracking

Teachers often manage multiple students across different levels (Hifz, Murājaʿah, Tilāwah) without a centralized system to record daily lessons. This results in:
- Difficulty recalling exact lesson history
- Inconsistent tracking across weeks
- Increased cognitive load on teachers

---

### 2. Limited Parent Visibility

Parents typically receive updates only when issues arise or when they actively ask. This creates:
- Uncertainty about student consistency
- Over-reliance on direct teacher communication
- Misalignment of expectations between teachers and parents

---

### 3. Inconsistent Student Accountability

Without a visible record of past lessons:
- Students may lose track of assignments
- Progress feels abstract rather than measurable
- Long-term consistency becomes difficult to maintain

---

### 4. Administrative Overhead for Teachers

Manual updates, repeated explanations, and individual follow-ups add non-teaching workload. Over time, this:
- Reduces teaching efficiency
- Creates burnout risk
- Pulls focus away from instruction and mentorship

---

## Impact

These challenges collectively lead to:
- Reduced learning consistency  
- Lower transparency between teachers and families  
- Difficulty maintaining quality as programs grow  

For Islamic and Qur’anic schools aiming to expand online or serve more students, the absence of structured yet respectful tooling becomes a significant limitation.

---

## Opportunity

There is a clear opportunity for a **lightweight, purpose-built Educational SaaS** that:
- Preserves traditional Qur’an teaching methods  
- Introduces structure without complexity  
- Improves accountability through visibility  
- Minimizes administrative effort for teachers  

Mudarris is designed to address these gaps while remaining aligned with the values and realities of Qur’anic education.
