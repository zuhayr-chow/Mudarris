# AI Concepts (Exploratory) — Mudarris

**Product Type:** Educational SaaS (Islamic & Qur’anic schools)  
**Phase:** Exploratory / Conceptual  
**AI Status:** Non-production, Assistive Only

This document outlines **potential AI-assisted concepts** for Mudarris. These ideas are exploratory and intended to support teachers—not replace instruction, judgment, or spiritual guidance.

All concepts are subject to validation, ethical review, and teacher oversight.

---

## AI Design Philosophy

AI within Mudarris is guided by the following principles:

- **Assistive, not authoritative**  
- **Teacher-reviewed outputs only**  
- **No autonomous religious decisions**  
- **No replacement of human instruction**  
- **Privacy-first and minimal data usage**

AI is positioned as a **productivity and insight tool**, not a teaching authority.

## AI Concept 1: Lesson Summary Assistant

### Description
After a teacher logs a lesson, AI can generate a **draft summary** for parent visibility.

### Example Use Case
- Teacher logs: Hifz + Murājaʿah + notes  
- AI drafts a short, neutral summary  
- Teacher reviews and approves before sharing  

### Example Output
> “Today’s lesson focused on reviewing Surah Al-Mulk (āyāt 1–5) with emphasis on correct makhārij. Continued review is recommended.”

### Value
- Saves teacher time  
- Improves clarity for parents  
- Maintains teacher control  

---

## AI Concept 2: Progress Pattern Insights (Teacher-Facing)

### Description
AI analyzes lesson history to surface **non-judgmental patterns**, such as consistency or review frequency.

### Example Insights
- “Student has reviewed the same surah for 3 consecutive sessions.”  
- “Murājaʿah frequency decreased over the last two weeks.”

### Value
- Supports instructional planning  
- Reduces reliance on memory  
- Does not assign grades or judgments  

---

## AI Concept 3: Suggested Focus Areas (Advisory Only)

### Description
Based on lesson history, AI may suggest **areas to focus on next**, presented as optional prompts.

### Example Prompt
> “Based on recent lessons, would you like to focus on strengthening murājaʿah consistency?”

### Guardrail
- Suggestions are optional  
- No automatic lesson changes  
- Teacher has final authority  

---

## AI Concept 4: Parent-Facing Progress Translation

### Description
AI helps translate technical lesson notes into **parent-friendly language**, without altering meaning.

### Example
Teacher note:
> “Struggled with ghunnah rules in ayah transitions.”

Parent-friendly version:
> “We are focusing on improving pronunciation consistency during transitions.”

### Value
- Improves communication  
- Reduces misunderstanding  
- Preserves teacher intent  

---

## AI Concept 5: Internal Search & Recall Assistance

### Description
AI enables teachers to quickly retrieve past lesson information.

### Example Queries
- “When did the student last review Surah Ya-Sin?”  
- “Which lessons included tajwīd feedback?”

### Value
- Improves efficiency  
- Saves time during lesson planning  

---

## Explicit Non-Goals for AI

AI in Mudarris will **not**:
- Issue religious rulings or interpretations  
- Evaluate spiritual quality or sincerity  
- Replace teacher feedback  
- Automatically advance students  
- Rank or compare students  

---

## AI Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: Over-Reliance on AI Outputs
**Mitigation:**  
- Teacher approval required  
- Clear labeling of AI-generated content  

### Risk: Hallucinations or Inaccuracies
**Mitigation:**  
- Restrict AI input to structured lesson data  
- Avoid open-ended prompts  

### Risk: Cultural or Pedagogical Misalignment
**Mitigation:**  
- Validate concepts with Qur’an teachers  
- Maintain conservative rollout  

---

## Phase Awareness

All AI concepts are **future-facing and exploratory**.  
No AI functionality is assumed to exist in the MVP.

AI development would only proceed after:
- Core product validation  
- Teacher buy-in  
- Ethical and pedagogical review
