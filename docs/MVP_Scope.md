# MVP Scope & Prioritization — Mudarris

**Product Type:** Educational SaaS (Islamic & Qur’anic schools)  
**Phase:** Planning & MVP Definition  
**Goal:** Deliver core value with minimal complexity

---

## MVP Philosophy

The Mudarris MVP is intentionally **narrow in scope**.  
Its purpose is to validate whether **structured lesson tracking and passive parent visibility** meaningfully improve consistency and accountability in Qur’an education.

Features are prioritized based on:
- Core user value
- Frequency of use
- Simplicity of adoption
- Alignment with traditional Qur’anic teaching workflows

---

## In-Scope Features (MVP)

| Feature | Included | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| User & classroom management | ✅ | Required to organize students and teachers |
| Daily lesson planner | ✅ | Core product value |
| Lesson history timeline | ✅ | Enables accountability and progress review |
| Parent visibility (read-only) | ✅ | Reduces manual communication |
| Class announcements | ✅ | Scales teacher communication |
| Basic Qur’an viewer (highlight only) | ✅ | Clarifies assigned homework |
| Student self-view (13+) | ✅ | Supports accountability for older students |

---

## Conditionally Included (If Low Effort)

| Feature | Condition |
|------|-----------|
| Mark lesson as completed | Included only if simple to implement |
| Offline caching | Included only if it does not add complexity |
| Onboarding tutorial | Included if needed to reduce confusion |

These features are evaluated based on **implementation simplicity**, not ambition.

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope (Post-MVP)

| Feature | Reason for Exclusion |
|------|---------------------|
| Audio reciter libraries | Not required to validate core value |
| Gamification (points, badges) | Risks distracting from learning intent |
| Advanced Qur’an search | Adds complexity without MVP validation |
| PDF or report exports | Low early-stage demand |
| Homework quizzes | Shifts product toward LMS behavior |
| Analytics dashboards | Premature before adoption validation |

---

## Tradeoffs Made

- **Simplicity over feature richness**  
- **Teacher workflow over student engagement mechanics**  
- **Visibility over automation**  

These tradeoffs ensure the MVP remains usable and aligned with Qur’anic education norms.

---

## Validation Criteria

The MVP will be considered successful if:
- Teachers consistently log lessons after classes  
- Parents regularly check progress without messaging teachers  
- Students show improved consistency over time  

These criteria will inform future roadmap decisions.

---

## Phase Awareness

This MVP scope reflects **planning-phase assumptions**.  
Final inclusion decisions will depend on user feedback and early usage patterns.
