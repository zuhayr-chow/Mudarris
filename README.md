# Mudarris — Educational SaaS Concept (Planning Phase)

<img width="500" height="500" alt="مدرس (3)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccdce7e0-10e5-4295-a228-51a620994aca" />


Mudarris is a **planning-phase Educational SaaS concept** designed specifically for **Islamic and Qur’anic schools**, madāris, masjid programs, and online Qur’an institutes.

The product focuses on improving **structure, accountability, and visibility** in Qur’an education—without disrupting traditional teaching methods or increasing administrative burden for teachers.

This repository represents a **Product Management case study**, emphasizing discovery, MVP definition, prioritization, and roadmap planning rather than production development.

## Problem

Qur’an education is often delivered through personalized, traditional instruction. However, lesson tracking and communication are frequently handled through informal tools such as:

- WhatsApp messages  
- Paper notebooks  
- Verbal updates  
- Teacher memory  

As programs grow or move online, these methods lead to:

- Inconsistent lesson tracking  
- Limited visibility for parents  
- Reduced student accountability  
- Increased administrative load for teachers  

Generic EdTech tools often fail to align with the realities and values of Qur’anic education.

---

## Solution (Concept)

Mudarris proposes a **lightweight Educational SaaS platform** that supports Qur’an education by enabling:

- Structured daily lesson logging (Hifz, Murājaʿah, Tilāwah)  
- Automatic, read-only parent visibility into progress  
- Clear lesson history for accountability  
- Simple class-level announcements  

The product is intentionally **minimal, respectful, and teacher-centered**.

---

## Current Status

🟡 **Planning & MVP Definition Phase**

- Product vision and problem framing completed  
- User personas defined (teacher, parent, student)  
- MVP scope and prioritization documented  
- User flows and roadmap outlined  
- Hypothesized success metrics defined  
- Risks and mitigations identified  
- Exploratory AI concepts documented (non-production)  

❌ No production application built  
❌ No real user data or metrics

## Target Users

- **Qur’an Teachers (Mudarris):** Need structure without admin overhead  
- **Parents / Guardians:** Want clear visibility into progress  
- **Students (13+):** Benefit from clarity, consistency, and accountability  

The product follows a **B2B2C model**, where institutions or teachers adopt the platform and families benefit from improved transparency.

---

## MVP Focus

The MVP is intentionally narrow and validation-driven.

**In scope:**
- User and classroom management  
- Daily lesson planner  
- Lesson history timeline  
- Parent read-only access  
- Class announcements  
- Basic Qur’an viewer (highlight-only)

**Out of scope (post-MVP):**
- Audio reciters  
- Gamification  
- Advanced Qur’an search  
- Quizzes or assessments  
- Analytics dashboards

## AI Positioning

AI concepts in Mudarris are **exploratory and assistive only**.

- No automated religious decisions  
- No replacement of teacher judgment  
- Teacher review required for all AI outputs  
- Privacy-first and minimal data usage  

AI is framed as a **support tool**, not an authority.

---

## Goal of This Project

This repository demonstrates my approach to:

- Product discovery and problem framing  
- User-centered design in religious education contexts  
- MVP scoping and prioritization  
- Roadmap planning and phased thinking  
- Responsible AI product design  

Mudarris is presented as a **Product Management case study** within the **Islamic EdTech** space.

---

## Next Steps (Conceptual)

- Validate assumptions with teachers and parents  
- Build a lightweight prototype (optional)  
- Iterate on scope based on feedback

This project represents **planning-phase work only**.  
All features, metrics, and AI concepts are hypothetical and subject to validation before any development.
