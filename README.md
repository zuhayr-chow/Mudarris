# Mudarris — Educational SaaS Concept

Mudarris is a **planning-phase Educational SaaS concept** designed to improve structure, accountability, and visibility in Qur’an education for teachers, parents, and students.

This project focuses on **product discovery, MVP definition, and roadmap planning** rather than full application development.

---

## Problem

Qur’an education—especially in online and small-institute settings—is often managed through informal tools such as WhatsApp messages, notebooks, or memory-based tracking. This leads to:

- Inconsistent lesson tracking for teachers  
- Limited visibility for parents into student progress  
- Lack of structured feedback and historical records for students  

These gaps reduce learning quality, accountability, and long-term consistency.

---

## Solution (Concept)

Mudarris proposes a **lightweight Educational SaaS platform** that enables:

- Structured daily lesson logging (Hifz, Murājaʿah, Tilāwah)
- Automatic parent visibility into student progress
- Simple classroom grouping and announcements
- A clear lesson history timeline for accountability

The product is intentionally designed to be **minimal, focused, and easy to adopt**.

## Current Phase

🟡 **Planning & MVP Definition Phase**

- Product vision and problem definition completed  
- MVP scope and feature prioritization defined  
- User personas and flows documented  
- Exploratory AI concepts drafted (non-production)  
- No production application built yet  

---

## Target Users

- **Teachers (Mudarris):** Need structured lesson tracking without admin overhead  
- **Parents:** Want visibility into consistency and progress  
- **Students (13+):** Benefit from clarity, history, and accountability  

---

## MVP Focus

- User & classroom management  
- Daily lesson planner  
- Lesson history & progress tracking  
- Parent visibility  
- Basic announcements & messaging  

Advanced features (audio reciters, gamification, analytics) are intentionally **out of scope** for the initial MVP.

---

## Product Documentation

All product planning documents are available in the `/docs` directory, including:

- Product Vision  
- Problem Statement  
- User Personas  
- Product Requirements Document (PRD)  
- MVP Scope & Roadmap  
- Success Metrics & Risk Analysis  

---

## Goal of This Project

This repository demonstrates my approach to:

- Product discovery and problem framing  
- MVP scoping and prioritization  
- User-centered design  
- Roadmap planning  
- Early-stage AI product thinking  

This project is intended as a **Product Management case study** within the EdTech domain.

## Next Steps

- Finalize planning documents  
- Build a lightweight prototype (optional)  
- Validate assumptions through user feedback
